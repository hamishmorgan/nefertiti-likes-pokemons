The program is for now very basic... and close to useless.

Still to do:
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]

To develop:
- would very probably be a good idea to display information on the type of features that 
were used (from bybloParams) as it obviously has an impact on the way the MAGIC parameters affect the data!
- running time vs. occurences/types ratio???? (reflects sparsity of the data???)

!!! Histograms for similarity not working at the moment.
