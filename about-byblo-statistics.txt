The program is for now very basic... and close to useless.


Still to do:
MINOR >> 
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]
- add a warning when illogical "reuse" option
- maybe display percentage together with size in Input-vs-files plots?

REAL WORK >> 
- distribution models?
- linear plots and models for parameters => process parameter plots individually (yes, that means a lot of work... :) )


To develop:
- the function determineColors (should it be coloUrs?) is ridiculous at the moment... [Really ridiculous. Should do something.]
- the one for times could be improved too (days & weeks)
- information on memory usage
