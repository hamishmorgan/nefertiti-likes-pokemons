The program is for now very basic... and close to useless.

Still to do:
- why are there several colors in some histograms?????????????????
- verify xhat happens to the reuse option after events handling. should be reused: same data => same stats => same graphs :)
- delete [option on set] before exiting
- remove permissions?
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]

To develop:
- find what is really needed (clearly, plots as they are now present no interest at all)
- cumulative (easy), inverted (?) graphs
- would very probably be a good idea to display information on the type of features that 
were used (from bybloParams) as it obviously has an impact on the way the MAGIC parameters affect the data!
- running time vs. occurences/types ratio???? (reflects sparsity of the data???)
