The program is for now very basic... and close to useless.


Still to do:
MINOR >> 
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]
- add a warning when illogical "reuse" option
- add an option to separate graphs (so that they can be used independently)
- only plot when something varies (lists with at least 2 elements)
- maybe display percentage together with size in Input-vs-files plots

REAL WORK >> 
- information on memory usage
- models?


To develop:
- would very probably be a good idea to display information on the type of features that 
were used (from bybloParams) as it obviously has an impact on the way the MAGIC parameters affect the data!
- the function determineColors (should it be coloUrs?) is ridiculous at the moment...
- the one for times could be improved too (days & weeks)
