The program is for now very basic... and close to useless.


Still to do:
MINOR >> 
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]
- add a warning when illogical "reuse" option

REAL WORK >> 
- vary Byblo parameters (seems like the only tricky bit is the reassembly of appropriate dictionnaries
from statistics files...)
- problem with the features files...
- ==>> information on memory usage


To develop:
- would very probably be a good idea to display information on the type of features that 
were used (from bybloParams) as it obviously has an impact on the way the MAGIC parameters affect the data!
- the function determineColors (should it be coloUrs?) is ridiculous at the moment...
- the one for times could be improved too (days & weeks)
